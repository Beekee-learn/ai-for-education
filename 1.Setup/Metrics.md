# Metrics

To assess the effectiveness of text generation on a Raspberry Pi 5, we defined the following criteria:

-   **Model loading time**: Duration to load the model into memory.
-   **Input evaluation time**: Duration to process the input and start text generation.
-   **Response generation time**: Time required to produce the response.

In parallel, to measure the impact on the Raspberry Pi, we took into account:

-   **RAM usage**: Amount of memory used.
-   **CPU load**: Processor usage level.
-   **Power consumption**: Energy and power used during the operation.
-   **CPU temperature**: Temperature evolution during the process.

These indicators will help us understand the feasibility and efficiency of deploying text generation models on limited capacity devices.
