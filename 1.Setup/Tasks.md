# Identification of Potential Tasks
---

In the initial phase, our project explored a range of tasks suitable for the Raspberry Pi, encompassing various aspects of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Among these, we considered:

-   **Text generation**, to automatically produce written content.
-   **Question-answering processing**, to provide precise answers to specific inquiries.
-   **Document analysis and interpretation**, to extract and synthesize key information.
-   **Document summarization**, to condense long texts into essential points.
-   **Translation between languages**, to facilitate multilingual communication.
-   **Text-to-text transformation**, to rephrase or adapt content.
-   **Text-to-speech conversion**, to generate a vocal output from written text.
-   **Image production based on textual descriptions**, to visualize concepts or ideas.
-   **Text recognition in images**, to extract and process written information on visual media.
-   **Completion of masked text segments**, to predict missing words or phrases.
-   **Image classification**, to identify and categorize visual elements.
-   **Object detection in images**, to locate and recognize specific objects.
-   **Development of conversational agents**, to simulate natural dialogues.
-   **Automatic code generation**, to convert natural language descriptions into executable computer code.
-   **Text evaluation**, to assess the quality of written responses.

These tasks represent a wide array of AI application possibilities on compact devices, highlighting the potential of the Raspberry Pi in various contexts.

## Focus on Text Generation

We chose to focus on text generation, a task both versatile and suited to many contexts. It can be used to create automatic responses, summaries, translations, or even code from descriptions. This task also presents an interesting challenge in terms of computational resources, making it an excellent candidate to test performance.
