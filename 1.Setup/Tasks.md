# Identification of Potential Tasks

In the initial phase, our project explored a range of tasks suitable for the Raspberry Pi, encompassing various aspects of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Among these, we considered:

-   **Text generation**, to automatically produce written content.
-   **Question-answering processing**, to provide precise answers to specific inquiries.
-   **Document analysis and interpretation**, to extract and synthesize key information.
-   **Document summarization**, to condense long texts into essential points.
-   **Translation between languages**, to facilitate multilingual communication.
-   **Text-to-text transformation**, to rephrase or adapt content.
-   **Text-to-speech conversion**, to generate a vocal output from written text.
-   **Image production based on textual descriptions**, to visualize concepts or ideas.
-   **Text recognition in images**, to extract and process written information on visual media.
-   **Completion of masked text segments**, to predict missing words or phrases.
-   **Image classification**, to identify and categorize visual elements.
-   **Object detection in images**, to locate and recognize specific objects.
-   **Development of conversational agents**, to simulate natural dialogues.
-   **Automatic code generation**, to convert natural language descriptions into executable computer code.
-   **Text evaluation**, to assess the quality of written responses.

These tasks represent a wide array of AI application possibilities on compact devices, highlighting the potential of the Raspberry Pi in various contexts.

## Focus on Text Generation

We chose to focus on text generation, a task both versatile and suited to many contexts. It can be used to create automatic responses, summaries, translations, or even code from descriptions. This task also presents an interesting challenge in terms of computational resources, making it an excellent candidate to test performance.

# Other promising tasks: 

## Text Evaluation

An intriguing avenue for exploration is the application of models dedicated to text evaluation. These models, capable of assessing responses against a set of criteria, hold immense potential for the educational sector. By automating the evaluation process, we can provide immediate feedback to learners, thereby enhancing the learning experience. A example of this application involves evaluating students' explanations of complex concepts, comparing their responses with reference answers, and grading them based on a predefined rubric. This not only streamlines the assessment process but also ensures consistency and objectivity in evaluations.

## Local Translation

Another promising direction involves the integration of automatic translation models. Tailoring these models to function autonomously on devices with limited computing power, such as Raspberry Pis, can revolutionize communication within isolated multilingual communities. This capability would enable the seamless translation of essential documents, facilitate communication in medical or emergency situations, and support educational initiatives in multiple languages.

## Code Generation

Exploring the potential of code generation models represents a significant leap forward. Enabling these models to generate code from natural language descriptions on less powerful devices could democratize programming education and software development, especially in regions with limited internet access. This approach could empower individuals to learn new programming languages and bring their ideas to life, fostering innovation and creativity.

## Diversified Model Architectures

A logical progression for this project involves evaluating the performance of models with different architectures, such as Mistral models, or those designed for tasks other than text generation. Understanding how these varied architectures and specializations perform in our targeted environment could lead to more tailored and effective AI applications. This exploration is crucial for identifying models that offer the best balance between performance and resource efficiency.

## Framework Exploration

Continuing our project, a deep dive into the capabilities and offerings of platforms like **HuggingFace** becomes essential. **HuggingFace**, known for its extensive range of pre-trained models and user-friendly tools, can serve as a valuable resource for expanding our project's scope. By leveraging the platform's models and tools, we can experiment with a wider array of applications and potentially discover new ways to enhance our project's effectiveness and reach.
