Setup
This section outlines the foundational elements that guided the feasibility assessment of our learning-by-doing pilot. The process began with task delineation, specifying objectives and requirements, which informed the model selection and performance measurement strategies. These elements were complemented by targeted methods that facilitated both rapid iterations and reliable outcomes.

- [Tasks](/1.Setup/Tasks.md)
Establish clear objectives aligned with pilot goals.
Identify and prioritize challenges specific to data and learning context.
Develop a structured timeline to coordinate stages and milestones.

- [Models](/1.Setup/Models.md)
-- Select models tailored to address defined tasks effectively.
-- Assess models' suitability based on complexity, interpretability, and alignment with pilot outcomes.
-- Evaluate model adaptability to iterate as pilot data evolves.
-- Metrics

Set performance indicators critical to measuring feasibility.
Define benchmark thresholds for each metric to gauge progress.
Implement continuous metric evaluations to ensure alignment with objectives.
Methods

Apply data preprocessing and feature selection to enhance model efficacy.
Integrate optimization and tuning techniques to support iterative learning.
Employ validation and ensemble techniques to improve robustness and generalizability.
