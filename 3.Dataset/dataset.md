In the serene town of Rivendale, nestled in the heart of the Green Valley, the community faced a pivotal moment that would test their resilience, unity, and commitment to environmental stewardship. The Green Valley, known for its lush landscapes, vibrant ecosystems, and rich agricultural heritage, had become the target of a large corporation planning to establish a vast mining operation. This venture promised economic growth and job opportunities but at a significant environmental cost, threatening the very essence of Rivendale and its surroundings.

The news of the impending project spread quickly, igniting a wave of concern among the townsfolk. The town hall meetings, once sparsely attended, were now overflowing with residents eager to voice their anxieties and seek solutions. Amidst the growing unrest, a group of local environmentalists, scientists, and concerned citizens formed the "Guardians of the Green Valley," a coalition dedicated to protecting their home from the irreversible damage of the proposed mining.

The Guardians launched a multifaceted campaign, employing scientific research, community outreach, and legal challenges to highlight the detrimental environmental impacts of the mining operation. They organized workshops to educate the community on sustainable practices, biodiversity conservation, and the importance of preserving water sources, which were at risk of contamination.

Simultaneously, the corporation embarked on a robust public relations campaign, touting the economic benefits and downplaying the environmental risks. They promised state-of-the-art technology to minimize ecological disruption and generous donations to local development projects.

The tension between economic development and environmental preservation sparked a heated debate within Rivendale. Some residents, facing economic hardships, saw the mining project as a much-needed lifeline. Others feared the loss of their town's soul, envisioning a future where the lush valleys were replaced by barren landscapes and polluted waters.

As the battle lines were drawn, the Guardians of the Green Valley realized they needed a broader strategy. They reached out to national environmental organizations, seeking expertise and legal support. They also launched a digital campaign to garner wider public support, sharing the unique beauty and ecological importance of the Green Valley through social media, blogs, and video content.

The climax of this struggle came when the environmental coalition organized a massive "March for the Green Valley," drawing participants from across the region. The peaceful march demonstrated the community's unity and commitment to protecting their environment. The compelling visuals of families, farmers, and activists standing together caught the attention of national media, bringing the issue to the forefront of public consciousness.

In the futuristic city of Aeonis, where technology and nature have intertwined to create a utopia, the annual Festival of Renewal celebrates this harmonious existence. However, beneath the surface of celebration, a challenge to the city's sustainability emerges. Aeonis, powered by an advanced AI named Terra, relies on a network of bio-digital forests that cleanse the air, produce energy, and maintain the city's ecological balance. But Terra alerts the city council that the forests are failing, victims of a mysterious blight that technology can't fix.

The council, divided between those who trust in technology to solve the crisis and those who believe in returning to traditional conservation methods, struggles to find a solution. Amid this division, Kai, a young engineer with a passion for botany, discovers ancient seeds in a forgotten vault deep within one of the bio-digital forests. These seeds, according to historical records, belong to plants once known for their restorative properties, capable of healing the land.

Kai, with the help of Lin, a traditional herbalist, and Alex, a software developer, embarks on a journey to reintroduce these plants into the forests. They face opposition from both sides of the council and skepticism from the public, who have grown distant from the natural world. Despite the obstacles, the trio's experiment begins to show signs of success. The ancient plants, with a little help from modified drones and Terra's guidance, start to rejuvenate the forests.

The turning point comes during the Festival of Renewal, when the city witnesses the transformation of the bio-digital forests. The blight recedes, and the forests thrive, blending ancient flora with futuristic technology. The success of Kai's project demonstrates that solutions can be found in the synergy between technology and nature, rather than in choosing one over the other.

The event unites Aeonis, rekindling a city-wide appreciation for the environment and sparking a movement towards integrating more traditional ecological knowledge with technological advancements. The story of Aeonis becomes a beacon of hope for other cities facing environmental challenges, showing that even in a world dominated by technology, the answers may lie in the roots of the past.

Finally, the Festival of Renewal becomes a symbol of Aeonis' commitment to sustainability, innovation, and the preservation of the natural world, inspiring a new era of environmental stewardship and harmony between humanity and nature.

Chapter One

His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who had never seen Trantor before. That is, not in real life. He had seen it many times on the hyper-video, and occasionally in tremendous three-dimensional newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or the opening of a Galactic Council. Even though he had lived all his life on the world of Synnax, which circled a star at the edges of the Blue Drift, he was not cut off from civilization, you see. At that time, no place in the Galaxy was.

There were nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets in the Galaxy then, and not one but owed allegiance to the Empire whose seat was on Trantor. It was the last half-century in which that could be said.

To Gaal, this trip was the undoubted climax of his young, scholarly life. He had been in space before so that the trip, as a voyage and nothing more, meant little to him. To be sure, he had traveled previously only as far as Synnax's only satellite in order to get the data on the mechanics of meteor driftage which he needed for his dissertation, but space-travel was all one whether one travelled half a million miles, or as many light years.

He had steeled himself just a little for the Jump through hyper-space, a phenomenon one did not experience in simple interplanetary trips. The Jump remained, and would probably remain forever, the only practical method of travelling between the stars. Travel through ordinary space could proceed at no rate more rapid than that of ordinary light (a bit of scientific knowledge that belonged among the items known since the forgotten dawn of human history), and that would have meant years of travel between even the nearest of inhabited systems. Through hyper-space, that unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing, one could traverse the length of the Galaxy in the interval between two neighboring instants of time.

Gaal had waited for the first of those jumps with a little dread curled gently in his stomach, and it ended in nothing more than a trifling jar, a little internal kick which ceased an instant before he could be sure he had felt it. That was all.

And after that, there was only the ship, large and glistening; the cool production of 12,000 years of Imperial progress; and himself, with his doctorate in mathematics freshly obtained and an invitation from the great Hari Seldon to come to Trantor and join the vast and somewhat mysterious Seldon Project.

What Gaal was waiting for after the disappointment of the Jump was that first sight of Trantor. He haunted the View-room. The steel shutter-lids were rolled back at announced times and he was always there, watching the hard brilliance of the stars, enjoying the incredible hazy swarm of a star cluster, like a giant conglomeration of fireflies caught in mid-motion and stilled forever. At one time there was the cold, blue-white smoke of a gaseous nebula within five light years of the ship, spreading over the window like distant milk, filling the room with an icy tinge, and disappearing out of sight two hours later, after another Jump.

The first sight of Trantor's sun was that of a hard, white speck all but lost in a myriad such, and recognizable only because it was pointed out by the ship's guide. The stars were thick here near the Galactic center. But with each Jump, it shone more brightly, drowning out the rest, paling them and thinning them out.

An officer came through and said, "View-room will be closed for the remainder of the trip. Prepare for landing."

Gaal had followed after, clutching at the sleeve of the white uniform with the Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire on it.

He said, "Would it be possible to let me stay? I would like to see Trantor."

The officer smiled and Gaal flushed a bit. It occurred to him that he spoke with a provincial accent.

The officer said, "We'll be landing on Trantor by morning."

"I mean I want to see it from Space."

"Oh. Sorry, my boy. If this were a space-yacht we might manage it. But we're spinning down, sun-side. You wouldn't want to be blinded, burnt, and radiation-scarred all at the same time, would you?"

Gaal started to walk away.

The officer called after him, "Trantor would only be a gray blur anyway, Kid. Why don't you take a space-tour once you hit Trantor. They're cheap."

Gaal looked back, "Thank you very much."

It was childish to feel disappointed, but childishness comes almost as naturally to a man as to a child, and there was a lump in Gaal's throat. He had never seen Trantor spread out in all its incredibility, as large as life, and he hadn't expected to have to wait longer.

Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.

Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization, from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations. Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use. Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.

Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago, is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.

History

The earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384--322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants. Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781--869), Al-Dīnawarī (828--896), who wrote on botany, and Rhazes (865--925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.

Biology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining. Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support spontaneous generation. However, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell theory.

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable---even suggesting the possibility of common descent.

In 1842, Charles Darwin penned his first sketch of On the Origin of Species.\
Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who presented a coherent theory of evolution. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.

The basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in 1865. This outlined the principles of biological inheritance. However, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the modern synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain.

Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality And Threatens Democracy by Cathy O'Neil (Allen Lane); Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari (Harvill Secker); The Master Algorithm: How The Quest For The Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World by Pedro Domingos (Allen Lane)

It was Greek/French philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis who argued that individuals in most societies do not depend on themselves to lay down their own law --- what he called autonomy. Instead, they assume that law is created by some external force found beyond themselves whether it be gods, nature, history, or reason --- heteronomy. As an increasingly influential force regulating social, electoral and economic outcomes, algorithms are among today's new heteronomous powers. In October 2016, the White House, European parliament and UK House of Commons each independently explored how to prepare society for the widespread use of algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI). Reviewing these governments' reports, researchers argued that the design of a 'good AI society' should be based on 'holistic respect' that considers 'the whole context of human flourishing' and 'nurturing of human dignity as the grounding foundation of a better world.' However, they concluded that all three reports lacked an understanding of how this technology can engender responsibility, co-operation and similar values to steer the development and inform the design of a 'good AI society'.

The word 'algorithm' comes from the 9th-century Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. Among his many innovations, al-Khwarizmi's work led to the creation of algebra and advanced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system that we use today. It is the Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi's name to 'Algoritmi' --- combined with an etymological mashup with the Greek word for number (ἀριθμός,pronounced 'are-eeth-mos') --- that gives us 'algorithm'.

Oxford University's Dictionary of Computer Science defines an algorithm as a prescribed set of well-defined rules or instructions for the solution of a problem, such as the performance of a calculation, in a finite number of steps. It is common to describe an algorithm as being similar to a recipe, say, for cooking pasta: 1) boil water, 2) add noodles, 3) stir. More precisely, the instructions need to be detailed enough for a computer to process, such as steps to play a game of tic-tac-toe: 'If you occupy two spaces in a row, play the third to get three in a row.' The work that al-Khwarizmi produced led to solutions for quadratic equations that are today applied to (among other uses) aircrafts taking flight and circuitry for computers and mobile devices. Despite these innovations, algorithms are playing a new role in the social-historical creation of societies, a contest between heteronomy and autonomy. Three interesting and very different books explore their potential use across a wide array of possibilities, from human domination to human liberation.

In his book The Master Algorithm Pedro Domingos, professor of computer science and engineering, provides an exhaustive overview of five rival orientations toward algorithms: 1) the Symbolists, who view learning as the inverse of deduction and take ideas from philosophy, psychology, and logic; 2) the Connectionists, who aspire to reverse engineer the brain and are inspired by neuroscience and physics; 3) the Evolutionaries, who simulate evolution on the computer and draw on genetics and evolutionary biology; 4) the Bayesians, who believe that learning is a form of probabilistic inference and have their roots in statistics; and 5) the Analogisers, who learn by extrapolating from similarity judgments and are influenced by psychology and mathematical optimisation. In his search for the Master Algorithm, Domingos declares his ultimate desideratum: a single algorithm that combines the key features of them all. This is important, he argues, because if it exists, 'the Master Algorithm can derive all knowledge in the world --- past, present, and future --- from data.'

Domingos's book not only sheds light on the inner technical workings of different types of algorithms that Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Google and other platform capitalisms use to shape our modern heteronomous experiences, but he also provides a sample algorithm --- 'Alchemy' --- to take for a test drive. His proposal for a Master Algorithm is rooted in pragmatic debates in the field as well as ideas for how to move them forward. However, the focus on abstract models distracts from discussion of real world negative impacts of this technology. For instance, Domingos's discussion of 'overfitting', a problem where an algorithm 'finds a pattern in the data that is not actually true in the real world,' seemed a woefully insufficient acknowledgment of the dangerous consequences of unaccountable algorithms --- their data inputs and code --- and the disastrous impact that they can have on people and communities --- such as when the postal code you live in helps determine your credit score and whether or not you qualify for a student or home loan. The book provides a window to see what is possible with a Master Algorithm in a general sense, but it delivers a techno-optimistic message when today's world of vast inequality and global precarity urgently demands that we ask how to leverage such technology for positive social change toward a classless world.
